For the moment all the relevant code is being developed in the "image" branch. Becca and I (Matheus) are currently working on the image procesing stuff and plan to finish all of this by the end of next week.

It would be nice to get started on the ML part by the end of next week.

(Feel free to  edit this and add more short-time plans here!)
