    "### Fourier Transform Speed Up\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier transform algorithm used in both OpenCV and Numpy is the Fast Fourier Transform. I will not go into details, but compared to the naive discrete fourier transform algorithm (DFT), the FFT algorithm is much faster, specially as the size of the image increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although FFT is proven to be more efficient than naive DFT, it is still much faster for array sizes of powers of two, three and five. This is due to the underlying symmetry of the FT calculation for real values; the FFT algorithm speeds up the DFT calculation by taking advantage of the complex conjugate symmetry of the FT if the input function is real. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Padding Up the Image\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, the FFT algorithm would perform optimally if, given an image $I$ the dimensions of the image $(h,w)$ are both powers of two, three or five, i.e $(h,w)=(2^{y_1}3^{y_2}5^{y_3}, 2^{x_1}3^{x_2}5^{x_3})$ for integers $x_i,y_i$. Therefore, the goal is to force the contents of the image into an array of shape $(2^{y_1}3^{y_2}5^{y_3}, 2^{x_1}3^{x_2}5^{x_3})$ by padding the image with zeros on the bottom and right. This zero-padding will not change the contents of the amplitude spectrum of the image, but may affect the phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below will implement a method of \"forcing\" the image into the optimal array size by padding it with zeros."
